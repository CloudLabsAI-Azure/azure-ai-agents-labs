# Labs

**Lab 1 - Setup AI Project and peform Chat Completion from VS Code**
<br> Lab 1 helps you to learn how to setup the necessary environment for  building the AI Agents. This includes:
* Setting up the AI Project in the Azure AI Foundry
* Deploying an LLM and embedding models
* Establish connectivity from VS Code into the AI Project
* Perform a simple Chat completion call

**Lab 2 Build a simple AI Agent**
<br>Lab 2 introduced you to AI Agents in Azure. You will learn how to build simple AI Agent that generates a bar chart comparing the health benefit plans.

**Lab 3 Perform RAG to index Health Plan data**
<br>In Lab 3, you will be applying Retrieval Augmented Generaton(RAG) on summary plan documents and store the embeddings in Azure AI Search.

**Lab 4 Develop multi-agents scenario to generate a report with health plan data from AI Search**
<br>In Lab 4, you will be creating below AI Agents: <br>
AI Agent 1. Querying the summary plan information <br>
AI Agent 2. Generating a report with the summary  plan information
