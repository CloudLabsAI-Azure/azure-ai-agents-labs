    "#### Step 2: Create the Search Agent\n",
    "To create the Search Agent, we can reuse the code from Lab 3 with a few key changes to integrate with Semantic Kernel. That is, we'll create a \"plugin\" for our Search Agent. A plugin in Semantic Kernel is a collection of actions that an Agent is able to take. In our case, the action that we want to take is searching an Azure AI Search index for our health plan documents. So we'll create a Search Agent plugin that has a search action. In code, this translates to creating a `SearchAgent` class and a kernel function for searching the Azure AI Search index. A \"kernel\" is the central component of Semantic Kernel and manages all the plugins and actions that are needed in the multi-agent system."
