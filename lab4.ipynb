    "# Lab 4: Multi-Agent Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll create a multi-agent system. The system will consist of 4 agents all working together to generate detailed reports about health insurance policy documents. Here are the 4 agents you will build:\n",
    "1. Search Agent - This agent will search an Azure AI Search index for information about specific health plan policies.\n",
    "2. Report Agent - This agent will generate a detailed report about the health plan policy based on the information returned from the Search Agent.\n",
    "3. Validation Agent - This agent will validate that the generated report meets specified requirements. In our case, making sure that the report contains information about coverage exclusions.\n",
    "4. Orchestrator Agent - This agent will act as an orchestrator that manages the communication between the Search Agent, Report Agent, and Validation Agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Orchestration is a key part of multi-agentic systems since the agents that we create need to be able to communicate with each other in order to accomplish the objective. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the Azure AI Agent Service to create the Search, Report, and Validation agents. However, to create the Orchestrator Agent, we'll use Semantic Kernel. The Semantic Kernel library provides out-of-the-box functionality for orchestrating multi-agent systems.\n"

    "To create the Search Agent, we can reuse the code from Lab 3 with a few key changes to integrate with Semantic Kernel. That is, we'll create a \"plugin\" for our Search Agent. A plugin in Semantic Kernel is a collection of actions that an Agent is able to take. In our case, the action that we want to take is searching an Azure AI Search index for our health plan documents. So we'll create a Search Agent plugin that has a search action. In code, this translates to creating a `SearchAgent` class and a kernel function for searching the Azure AI Search index. A \"kernel\" is the central component of Semantic Kernel and manages all the plugins and actions that are needed in the multi-agent system."
